This is a short analysis of synthetic heartbeat data using topological data analysis (TDA).  The analysis is done via a set of python programs which use the regular libraries like pandas, numpy and matplotlib to analyze the data plus neurokit2 and tda from giotto used to create the synthetic data and find anomalies in them in that order.
